### Overview
Our main goal is to create a tool for researchers which will make the process easier and simplify the way for getting up-to-date information.

###  Problem Statement (technology perspective)
It takes long time to find relevant and up-to-date information daily. Good to have brief overview of new tecnologies.

### Objectives
- Objective 1
- Objective 2
- Objective 3

### Features
- Feature 1: Summary of all papers that were released today.
- Feature 2: Search of the code bases that suit the papers for the selected topics of research (to give code examples).
- Feature 3: Filtering of the main papers by topic or by tecnical parametrs (limitations)
- Feature 4: Customers feedback that can affect the answer to give more relevant results
- Feature 5: Predict next steps of research, suggestions for the new topics and spheres that will help to solve current problem

### Timeline
- 18.11: Deliverables:
	- Parsing of the papers from huggingface (daily updates)
 	- Getting summary of these papers
  	- Search of code bases for the reserches found on previous steps
- 19.11: Deliverables:
	- Adding search conditions: filter by the topic
	- Adding search conditions: filter by tecnical limitations
- 20.11: Deliverables:
	- Communication with the found paper/article
 	- Customers feedback that can affect the answer to give more relevant results
- 21.11: Deliverables:
	- Reseearch forecast: predict next steps, interesting domains
